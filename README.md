Air Pollution has become a global problem with the rapid development of economics these days. More and more problems in society are raised due to the severe air pollution such as chronic diseases and respiratory diseases in some regions, so it is worth studying the air pollutent time series in New York City, which is one of the busiest and crowdest city in the world. An approproiate model may help with forecasting air pollution and also help with policy making. Here we are going to build seasonal ARIMA model to the series and make prediction about air pollution.
